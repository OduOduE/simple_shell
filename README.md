A project done by a team of two, in fulfilment of the first sprint of ALX SE.
It has to do with building a shell justlike the linux shell.

#DESCRIPTION
This is a team project given at the end of the first trimester at ALX. We were
required to apply the concepts thus learnt through the trimester into building
a simple shell similar to bash or dash. I must say that it wasn't easy at first
combining all the knowledge acquired into something that was big. We also
couldn't finish all the tasks required provided. We managed to implement the
mandatory tasks.

#GETTING mysh
In order to install mysh and get the benefits of the features it provides or
test or work on certain features:

    - Clone the repository
    - cd into the directory
    - run source ./build to compile it
    - If there is not error, run ./Gsh and enjoy our hardwork .

#PRESENT FEATURES
    - Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line
    always ends with a new line.
    - If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt
    again.
    - Handle errors.
    - Handling the command line with arguments.
    - Handle the PATH.
    - Support the exit features and the exit status.

#BUILTINS

#Usage
